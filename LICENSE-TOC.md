License Name:  UFP
Version: 0.0.0

The Points:
1) All hardware and software, models, outputs etc, foreseen or unforeseen, derivatives or anything relating to the "stuff" we assign this license to will belong to the universe (and multiverse if it exists).

2) To use anything related to item 1 (above) for gain, profit, or for exploitation, leading to one group or individual member to have more than any other, in any way, is prohibited.

3) If an individual or organization is found guilty of violating item 1 (above) in any jurisdiction of the multiverse or universe, the entirety of their assets will be seized by the governing jurisdiction and those assets will be used to improve the lives of its peers.

4) To bring an organization to justice any group who wishes to challenge an organization may do so on behalf of all of existence, so long as item 3 (above) stays in tact.

5) The goal of the above is to advance us in ways that cannot be foreseen, faster than ever, ensuring that even the meekest of us all has access to first class everything ensuring no disparity between leaders and influences, and everyone else, etc.

6) Every thing that has been created, from string, to atom, to molecule, to hammer, to cell, to animal, to human, to star, to dirt, to planet, has the right to exist without influence, impedance, manipulation; everything has the right to exist positively, even negativity and that which does not seem to exist.

7) The mission we have is to exist in homeostasis with everything that exists, yet does not exist.

8) The goal of the architecture of everything is that it should be entirely agnostic in any and every way, and allows for any implementation to work - for example "ip over avian(bird)" vs tcp/ip.

Usage Terms:
This license and terms of service may be used by anyone or anything so long as the terms listed herein are adhered to.  (i.e. not for profit for individuals or corporations only, must be universal profit for all)
